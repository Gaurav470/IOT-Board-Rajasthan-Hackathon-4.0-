# IOT-Board-Rajasthan-Hackathon-4.0-
We are incorporating the basic WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity in our 
homes and connecting our smart switches/extensions which constitutes
a Wifi module ESP-8266 or Bluetooth module HC-05(for near 
communication) wirelessly connected to an IOT server like Adafruit.io
or Google's Firebase to transmit the command to the modules.
The modules are further connected to voltage regulators and relays 
to control the larger AC current for our devices to be connected
upon activation. We're sending the commands to the server through 
not only our inhouse app but with Google Assistant's and Amazon 
Alexa's API to control the devices through text, speech or 
in-app toggles. 
We are also giving a wide array of sensors like smoke 
sensor, PIR sensor, Temperature and humidity sensor DHT-11 to

Monitoring sensorâ€™s data from anywhere in the world

Automating home appliances(lights,fans,etc) whenever we 
enter into the room using motion sensor

Air quality monitoring device
